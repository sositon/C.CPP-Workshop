 * General Assumptions:

 *    2. You may assume that all nodes and their data arrays are allocated dynamically.
 *    3. You may assume that there are no two nodes that their data fields point to the
 *       same array.

/**
 * calculates the grade average of every node in the linked list.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *    You cannot assume the pointers are valid.
 *    You don't know the number of nodes in the linkedlist in advance.
 *    You can assume that there is at least one node with data != NULL (i.e. len > 0).
 *    You can assume that for each node 'len' is indeed the length of 'data'
 *     (in particular len=0 <=> data=NULL).
 *
 * In case of errors:
 *    Invalid pointer - print informative message to stderr, free resources allocated by function,
 *                      return NULL from function.
 *    Allocation fail - print informative message to stderr, free resources allocated by function,
 *                      return NULL from function.
 *    Node with NULL data - don't count the node in the calculation.
 *
 * @param list: LinkedList pointer to linked list from whom to calculate grade averages.
 * @param num_elements_in_returned_array: pointer to unsigned long, that should contain the number of nodes in the list
 * (for nodes with data != NULL) when the function finishes execution. To be clear - at the start of the function,
 * (*num_elements_in_returned_array) is a garbage value, and this function should set its value.
 *    @Note: Nodes with NULL data should not be count in the calculation.
 *    Therefore *num_elements_in_returned_array <= numOfNodes.
 * @return array of grade averages per node. To be clear - this means you should
 * calculate the grade average of every node and save it into an array, which you will return from the function.

/**
 * opens a file from a given filename and parses it's contents into a LinkedList.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *    You cannot assume the filename is OK (meaning - you cannot assume it is a valid path to a file).
 *    You cannot assume anything on the number of ints in a row of the file, just that it is >= 1.
 *    You can assume that if the file opened, then it is exactly in the format specified in the exercise PDF.
 *    You can assume max line length of 1024.
 *
 * In case of errors:
 *    Invalid pointer - print informative message to stderr, free resources allocated by function,
 *                      return NULL from function.
 *    File open fail - print informative message to stderr, free resources allocated by function,
 *                      return NULL from function.
 *    Allocation fail - print informative message to stderr, free resources allocated by function,
 *                      return NULL from function.
 *
 * Think - in what mode should we open this file? (read? write? append?)
 *
 * @param file filename of input file that needs to be parsed.
 * @return pointer to LinkedList instance, whose nodes and data arrays were parsed from the given file.
